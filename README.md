CS294S, CS294W Assignments

You can work on the assignments in groups of 2-3 students, and submit the same deliverable for the whole team.

You should create a **private** copy of this repository on GitHub. You will need to pull new changes from this repository in the future. Since a private fork of a public repository is not possible, we recommend [duplicating it](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30352360), but a simple `clone`/`push` and then manually copying new changes from this repository should work as well.
